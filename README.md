 This print was a cube that was 8 layers tall and 15x15mm with a 10% infill. The printing material consisted of GelMa and Fibroblast cultured cells. A 1:5 cell to GelMa ratio was used and was achieved using the CELLINK cell mixer. This means for the 2mL of GelMa that was loaded, 0.4mL of cell/media mix was used. This scaffold was printed 3 times in a 6-well plate. Printing parameters include:
 * Print head pressure: (yes)
 * Print head temperature: 26°C
 * Print bed temperature: 20°C
 * Print speed: 10mm/sec
 * Cross linking frequency: After every layer
 * Cross linking time: 10sec
 * Cross linking wavelength: 405nm
 * Distance to center of build (Cross linking): 4cm

Once the prints were completed, they were washed with PBS 3 times and Life/Death Assay stain (Invitrogen) was added to the samples. The samples were left to sit for 15 minutes and then were observed under a confocal microscope. Two of the wells were observed under  the microscope. The 3D z-scan of the two wells can be seen below (within an hour of printing).
